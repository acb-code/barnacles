# ðŸª¸ barnacles

> Personal research notebook for ideas, derivations, and design notes across AI, ML, and agentic systems.

---

### Overview

**barnacles** is a living collection of personal notes â€” the accumulated residue of research, design work, and reading that attaches over time.  
Itâ€™s not a polished library or a formal publication space.

### Structure

```
barnacles/
â”œâ”€â”€ agentic_ai/          # LLM agents, coordination, self-play, planning
â”œâ”€â”€ coding/          # Snippets from coding interview studying
â”œâ”€â”€ optimization/ 
â”œâ”€â”€ rl/  
Many items are TBD or WIP
```

Each folder evolves independently â€” notes may be fragments, drafts, or cross-linked explorations.

### Usage

This repository isnâ€™t intended for external use or contributions.  
However, selected excerpts and distilled insights may appear in blog posts, technical write-ups, or public repositories.

If youâ€™re exploring similar intersections of **LLM agents**, **optimization**, and **multi-agent learning**, parts of these notes may serve as conceptual scaffolding for your own work.
